This video explains the basic operation of the LLC resonant DC-DC converter. The important points to correctly design and operate the converter are highlighted. The process of Zero Voltage Switching (ZVS) is detailed. An example on how to simulate this converter using LTspice is also presented. The simulation results are used to reinforce the ideas presented in the video.
